- Lyrics already written during Step 5
- Simply extract and pass - NO user input needed

**When called from standalone `/review-song`:**
- Parse file or user-provided text
- Extract genre, mood, vocals from prompt sections
- Sanitize and pass to quality-reviewer

**Character Count Handling:**
- Do NOT include character count in review request
- Quality-reviewer focuses on CONTENT quality
- Character verification already done in Step 7 (Verify)
- Only flag if character count EXCEEDS limit (critical issue)
