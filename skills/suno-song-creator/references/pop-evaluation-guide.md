# Pop Music Evaluation Guide

Specialized evaluation criteria for pop music, focusing on commercial viability, radio-ready quality, and avoiding common pitfalls that date songs or create licensing issues.

## Overview

Pop music evaluation requires different standards than other genres. What works in indie folk (specific brand names, narrative wordiness, explicit emotional statements) often **fails in pop** due to:
- Commercial considerations (licensing, radio play, brand partnerships)
- Timelessness requirements (pop songs need longevity, not just immediate relevance)
- Compression aesthetics (every word must earn its place)
- Universal relatability (accessible to broad audiences, not niche)

**Key Philosophy:** Pop prioritizes **emotional specificity** over **concrete brand specificity**.

---

## 1. Specificity Rules for Pop

### The Specificity Paradox

Pop lyrics need to be **specific enough to feel real** but **universal enough to be relatable**. The solution: focus on **emotional and action-based specificity**, not brand or product specificity.

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES - Flag Immediately

**Brand Names:**
- ❌ Product brands: "PlayStation", "Nintendo", "Xbox"
- ❌ Streaming services: "Spotify", "Netflix", "TikTok"
- ❌ Retail brands: "Costco", "Target", "Walmart"
- ❌ Tech brands: "iPhone", "Samsung", "Apple"
- ❌ Food/drink brands: "Starbucks", "McDonald's", "Coca-Cola"
- ❌ Car brands: "Tesla", "BMW", "Honda"

**Why CRITICAL:**
1. **Licensing issues** - May require clearance or payment to brand
2. **Commercial feel** - Sounds like product placement, not authentic songwriting
3. **Dating risk** - Products age, rebrand, or become obsolete
4. **Radio restrictions** - Some stations won't play songs with brand names

**Exceptions (rarely acceptable):**
- Brand has become generic shorthand ("Google it" for "search online")
- Intentional ironic commentary on consumerism (must be clear)
- Historical reference where brand is culturally significant

### ✅ GOOD SPECIFICITY - Recommend Instead

**Emotional Specificity:**
- ✅ "the way you smell" (specific sense, universal experience)
- ✅ "how you laugh when you're nervous" (specific behavior)
- ✅ "that look you give me" (specific but not branded)
- ✅ "3am texts" (specific time, relatable situation)
- ✅ "forget my birthday" (specific action, universal frustration)

**Action-Based Specificity:**
- ✅ "show up late" (specific behavior vs. "you're unreliable")
- ✅ "leave me on read" (contemporary but not branded)
- ✅ "scroll past my stories" (action without platform name)
- ✅ "play games too loud" (activity without console brand)
- ✅ "borrow money again" (specific action)

**Universal Objects (Generic):**
- ✅ "your car" (not "your Honda")
- ✅ "my phone" (not "my iPhone")
- ✅ "that shirt" (not "that Supreme shirt")
- ✅ "your playlist" (not "your Spotify playlist")
- ✅ "video games" (not "PlayStation")
- ✅ "grocery runs" (not "Costco runs")

### ⚠️ SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

**Overly Specific Personal Details:**
- ⚠️ "your Pokémon collection" → "your games" or "your cards"
- ⚠️ "limited edition action figure" → "collectible" or "that thing you wanted"
- ⚠️ "your Discord server" → "your group chat" or "online friends"

**Place-Specific References:**
- ⚠️ "7-Eleven parking lot" → "parking lot" or "corner store"
- ⚠️ "Brooklyn rooftop" → "rooftop" or "city lights" (unless location is thematically critical)

**Note:** Place names are MORE acceptable in pop than brand names, but still risky for commercial appeal.

## 2. Contemporary References & Dating Risk

### The Timelessness Test

Ask: "Will this reference work in 2030? 2035? 2040?"

If no, flag with appropriate severity based on how quickly it dates.

### ❌ CRITICAL - Dates Within 1-2 Years

**Specific Tech Products:**
- ❌ "iPhone 15", "PS5", "AirPods Max" (model-specific)
- ❌ "ChatGPT", "Midjourney" (may be obsolete or evolved)
- ❌ "2025", "pandemic era", "post-COVID" (year-specific references)

**Current Events/Culture:**
- ❌ Specific TikTok trends ("Renegade dance", "corn kid")
- ❌ Current memes that won't age ("rizz", "skibidi")
- ❌ Recent political/cultural moments

**Why CRITICAL:**
Makes song immediately dated. Listeners in 2027 will cringe.

### ⚠️ SUGGESTED - Dates Within 3-5 Years

**General Tech Categories:**
- ⚠️ "Spotify", "Netflix", "Instagram" (services that may evolve/die)
- ⚠️ "texting", "DMs", "stories" (language may shift)
- ⚠️ "livestream", "podcast", "vlog" (formats may change)

**Contemporary Slang:**
- ⚠️ "lowkey", "highkey", "slaps", "hits different"
- ⚠️ "vibe check", "main character energy"
- ⚠️ Current dating app language ("swipe right", "match")

**Why SUGGESTED:**
Acceptable for songs targeting current audience, but recognize trade-off: immediate relatability vs. longevity.

### ✅ OPTIONAL - Timeless or Slow-Aging

**Activities (Generic):**
- ✅ "video games", "music", "movies", "shows"
- ✅ "online", "screen time", "digital"
- ✅ "call", "text", "message" (generic verbs)

**Universal Slang:**
- ✅ "cool", "crazy", "wild" (decades-old, still working)
- ✅ "mess", "drama", "chaos"
- ✅ "crush", "ex", "friend"

**Emotional States:**
- ✅ "anxious", "excited", "confused"
- ✅ "jealous", "hopeful", "scared"

## 3. Wordiness Thresholds

### Pop Compression Philosophy

Pop lyrics are compressed, economical, **punchy**. Every word must earn its place. Contrast with folk/indie where wordiness serves narrative depth.

### Word Count Guidelines

**Target:**
- **Verses:** 6-8 words per line (maximum 10)
- **Chorus:** 5-7 words per line (maximum 8)
- **Bridge:** 6-9 words per line (can be slightly longer for contrast)
- **Pre-Chorus:** 6-8 words per line

### ❌ CRITICAL - Over 12 Words Per Line

**Example:**
```
❌ "I'm your therapist, your mom, your alarm clock, and basically everything you need in your life"
(17 words - way too wordy for pop)
```

**Why CRITICAL:**
- Impossible to sing smoothly
- Loses catchiness
- Sounds amateurish
- Breaks pop flow

### ⚠️ SUGGESTED - Over 10 Words Per Line

**Example:**
```
⚠️ "You forgot my birthday twice but remembered your Spotify login password"
(11 words - borderline acceptable, but could be tighter)

✅ Better: "Forgot my birthday twice / But remember your password"
(7 words - punchy, economical)
```

**Guidelines for Reduction:**
1. Remove unnecessary articles ("the", "a", "an")
2. Cut redundant descriptors
3. Use contractions ("don't" vs. "do not")
4. Eliminate filler words ("just", "really", "very")
5. Break long lines into two shorter lines

### ✅ ACCEPTABLE - 6-10 Words Per Line

**Examples:**
```
✅ "You showed up late with pizza stains" (7 words)
✅ "Living off your mother's grocery runs" (6 words)
✅ "Playing video games too loud" (5 words)
✅ "Asked to borrow money again" (5 words)
```

### Special Cases

**Repetition/Hooks:**
```
✅ "Boy, you're a project, project, project, yeah"
```
Repetition doesn't count against word limit - it's intentional for catchiness.

**Staccato Lists:**
```
✅ "I'm your therapist, your mom, your alarm clock, everything"
```
If delivered with pauses/staccato phrasing, slightly longer lines acceptable. But still flag as SUGGESTED improvement.

---

## 4. Show Don't Tell Balance

### The Pop Paradox: Direct but Not Explicit

Pop lyrics should be **emotionally direct** (listeners know exactly how you feel) but **narratively implicit** (showing through actions/images, not stating facts).

### ❌ CRITICAL - Overly Explicit Stating

**Problematic Pattern: "I'm your X, your Y, your Z"**

```
❌ "I'm your therapist, your mom, your alarm clock, everything"
```

**Why problematic:**
- States the dynamic explicitly instead of showing it
- Tells rather than shows
- Removes emotional discovery for listener
- Feels like over-explanation

### ⚠️ SUGGESTED - Show Through Actions

**Instead of stating roles, show behaviors:**

```
✅ "You call me at 3am / I always pick up
    Wake you for work / Make coffee, too"
```

**Why better:**
- SHOWS therapist/mom behavior without stating it
- Listener infers the dynamic
- More emotionally resonant
- Maintains pop directness while showing

### The 70/30 Rule for Pop

**Target ratio: 70% showing, 30% telling**

**Showing (70%):**
- Actions: "show up late", "forget to call", "leave me on read"
- Images: "pizza stains", "coffee cup", "empty bed"
- Dialogue: "You said you'd change"
- Sensory details: "smell like yesterday", "cold shoulder"

**Telling (30%):**
- Emotional states: "I'm in love", "I'm confused", "I'm done"
- Direct statements in chorus/hook: "Boy, you're a project"
- Bridge revelations: "Maybe I'm the problem"

### Examples: Show vs. Tell

**Telling (too explicit):**
```
❌ "You're immature and can't take care of yourself and I enable you"
```

**Showing (just right):**
```
✅ "Twenty-eight but acting twelve
    Living off your mother's grocery runs
    I do your laundry while you play your games"
```

**Why the second works:**
- SHOWS immaturity through specific behaviors
- IMPLIES enabling through narrator's actions
- Listener draws conclusions
- Pop-appropriate directness

## 5. Pop Lyric Best Practices

### Hooks & Catchiness

**Rule: The hook should be simple, memorable, repeatable**

**Good Hooks:**
- ✅ Short phrases: "Boy, you're a project"
- ✅ Question format: "Why do I keep coming back?"
- ✅ Contradiction: "I hate that I love you"
- ✅ Imagery: "Dancing in the dark"
- ✅ Wordplay: "You're hot then you're cold"

**Bad Hooks:**
- ❌ Too wordy: "I think maybe I'm realizing that you might be the one"
- ❌ Too vague: "It's complicated"
- ❌ Too complex: "The juxtaposition of our emotional states"

### Universal Experiences Over Niche Details

**Pop thrives on:**
- ✅ Heartbreak, jealousy, confusion, longing
- ✅ Relationship dynamics everyone recognizes
- ✅ Coming-of-age struggles
- ✅ Self-empowerment moments
- ✅ Dancing, parties, nights out
- ✅ Texting, calling, social dynamics

**Pop struggles with:**
- ❌ Hyper-specific niche hobbies (unless made universal)
- ❌ Inside jokes only some listeners get
- ❌ Obscure cultural references
- ❌ Overly intellectual concepts

### Radio-Friendly Language

**Avoid:**
- Controversial brand names (creates clearance issues)
- Explicit language (limits airplay - different from explicit *content*)
- Religious/political references (polarizing)
- Dated slang that will age badly

**Prefer:**
- Clean, accessible language
- Emotionally rich but not explicit
- Contemporary but not hyper-current
- Relatable to broad demographics

## 6. Common Pop Pitfalls to Flag

### Pitfall 1: Brand Name Overload

**Example:**
```
❌ "Snapchatting on my iPhone
    While you're playing PlayStation
    Ordering from DoorDash again
    Watching Netflix in your room"
```

**Why problematic:**
- Reads like advertisement, not art
- Every brand will date the song
- Licensing nightmare
- Loses emotional core in product names

**Fix:**
```
✅ "Texting on my phone
    While you're playing games again
    Ordering takeout 'cause you can't cook
    Watching shows alone in your room"
```

### Pitfall 2: Over-Explaining Dynamics

**Example:**
```
❌ "Our relationship is toxic because you're emotionally unavailable
    And I'm codependent and anxious-attached
    We're stuck in a cycle of push and pull"
```

**Why problematic:**
- Sounds like therapy session transcript
- Over-intellectualizes
- Removes emotional punch
- Tells listeners exactly what to think

**Fix:**
```
✅ "You pull away / I chase you down
    You come back / I let you in
    We're going in circles / Going nowhere"
```

### Pitfall 3: Filler Words & Padding

**Filler words to watch:**
- "just", "really", "very", "like", "kind of", "sort of"
- "I guess", "I think", "maybe"
- "yeah yeah yeah" (unless intentional hook)
- "oh oh oh" (overused as padding)

**When filler is acceptable:**
- Intentional hook repetition
- Rhythmic/sonic purpose
- Conversational tone (sparingly)

**When to flag:**
- Used to reach syllable count
- Adds no meaning or rhythm
- Could be replaced with stronger words

### Pitfall 4: Trying Too Hard to Be Clever

**Example:**
```
❌ "Your psychological defense mechanisms
    Are metaphorical walls I cannot breach
    The cognitive dissonance between us
    Is insurmountable and bittersweet"
```

**Why problematic:**
- Too intellectual for pop
- Vocabulary too complex
- Loses accessibility
- Sounds pretentious

**Fix:**
```
✅ "You put up walls I can't climb
    We want different things
    And that's breaking my heart"
```

### Pitfall 5: Mixed Tenses

**Watch for:**
```
❌ "You showed up late (past)
    But you're cute when you pout (present)
    And you'll probably forget (future)"
```

**Best practice:**
- Stick to one primary tense per section
- Present tense for immediacy: "You show up late"
- Past tense for storytelling: "You showed up late that night"
- Future tense sparingly: "We'll never work"

## 7. Genre-Specific Pop Subcategories

### Bubblegum Pop

**Extra Emphasis On:**
- Playful, fun language
- Upbeat even when topic is frustrating
- Lighter wordcount (5-7 words/line target)
- More acceptable repetition
- Avoid heavy/dark imagery

**Example:**
```
✅ "You're messy but you're mine
    Chaotic but I don't mind
    Late but worth the wait
    My favorite mistake"
```

### Pop-Rock

**Slightly More Lenient On:**

- Anthemic choruses

### Electro-Pop/Dance-Pop

**Extra Emphasis On:**
- Maximum compression (4-6 words/line ideal)
- Repetition is strength
- Fewer specific details, more vibe
- Energy over narrative

**Example:**
```
✅ "Lights flash / We move
    Bass drops / I'm lost in you
    All night / Won't stop
    Till the sun comes up"
```

### R&B-Pop

**Slightly More Lenient On:**
- Wordiness (can go 8-10 words/line)
- Explicit emotional statements
- More "telling" acceptable (50/50 show/tell)
- Vocal runs/repetition

## 8. Evaluation Workflow for Pop Songs

### Step 1: Brand Name Scan

**Process:**
1. Read through lyrics once
2. Highlight all proper nouns
3. Identify brand names, products, services
4. Flag each as CRITICAL with suggested generic alternative

### Step 2: Contemporary Reference Check

**Process:**
1. Identify tech-specific language
2. Identify current slang/memes
3. Identify year-specific references
4. Apply timelessness test: "Works in 2035?"
5. Flag based on dating speed (CRITICAL < 2 years, SUGGESTED < 5 years)

### Step 3: Wordiness Analysis

**Process:**
1. Count words per line for each section
2. Calculate averages: Verses, Chorus, Bridge
3. Flag lines over 10 words as SUGGESTED
4. Flag lines over 12 words as CRITICAL
5. Provide compressed alternatives

### Step 4: Show/Tell Ratio

**Process:**
1. Identify "telling" lines (explicit statements of roles, dynamics, feelings)
2. Identify "showing" lines (actions, images, behaviors)
3. Calculate rough ratio
4. Target 70/30 show to tell
5. Flag excessive "telling" as SUGGESTED
6. Provide showing-based alternatives

### Step 5: Hook Strength

**Assess:**
- Is the hook memorable?
- Can you imagine it repeated?
- Is it simple enough to sing along?
- Does it capture the song's essence?

**Flag if:**
- Too wordy for a hook
- Too vague/generic
- Too complex to remember

### Step 6: Universal Relatability

**Check:**
- Can broad audience relate?
- Is language accessible?
- Are references too niche?

---

## 9. Recommended vs. Problematic Language

### Recommended Pop Vocabulary

**Emotions (Direct):**
- love, hate, want, need, feel, know
- broken, whole, lost, found
- scared, brave, weak, strong

**Actions (Specific):**
- call, text, ghost, leave, stay
- dance, run, fall, fly, drown
- fight, break, fix, try, fail

**Universal Objects:**
- heart, mind, eyes, hands, lips
- bed, car, phone, door, window
- night, day, light, dark, fire, ice

**Relatable Experiences:**
- parties, driving, dancing, crying
- waiting, missing, hoping, dreaming

### Problematic Pop Vocabulary

**Too Brand-Specific:**
- Any product, service, or company name
- Specific tech (unless generic: "phone" OK, "iPhone" not)
- Retail/food brands

**Too Niche:**
- Obscure hobbies without universal framing
- Inside cultural references
- Technical jargon

**Too Intellectual:**
- Psychology/therapy terms (unless universal: "toxic" OK, "cognitive dissonance" not)
- Academic language
- Overly poetic/literary vocabulary

**Too Dated:**
- Current memes/slang
- Year-specific events
- Rapidly-evolving tech

---

## 10. When to Allow Exceptions

### Exception 1: Ironic Commentary

If the song is intentionally commenting on consumerism, technology addiction, or modern culture, brand names may serve the theme.

**Example:**
```
✅ Acceptable: "We're just brands and screens / Nothing real between"
(Using "brands" thematically, not naming specific brands)
```

### Exception 2: Genre-Bending

If the pop song is crossing into indie or alternative territory, slightly more specificity may be acceptable.

**Check:**
- Is this marketed as pure pop or indie-pop/alt-pop?
- What's the target audience expectation?
- Is radio play a goal?

### Exception 3: Nostalgic Reference

If referencing a past era for nostalgic effect, dated references may work.

**Example:**
```
✅ "Like we're back in '09
    When flip phones were cool"
```

**Only acceptable if:**
- Intentionally nostalgic
- Specific era is the theme
- Not trying to sound current

---

## 11. Final Checklist

Before approving pop lyrics, verify:

- [ ] **No brand names** (or rare exception clearly justified)
- [ ] **Contemporary references pass timelessness test**
- [ ] **Average wordcount 6-8 words/line or less**
- [ ] **Show/tell ratio approximately 70/30**
- [ ] **Hook is simple, memorable, repeatable**
- [ ] **Language is accessible to broad audience**
- [ ] **Universal experiences prioritized over niche details**
- [ ] **Emotional specificity used instead of brand specificity**
- [ ] **No filler words padding lines unnecessarily**
- [ ] **Tenses are consistent within sections**

---

## Summary

**Pop music evaluation is about finding the balance:**
- **Specific but universal** - "3am texts" not "Spotify login"
- **Contemporary but timeless** - "texting" not "TikTok"
- **Direct but not explicit** - Show through actions, not statements
- **Compressed but not vague** - Every word earns its place
- **Catchy but authentic** - Hooks that feel real

**When in doubt, ask:**
1. Will this work in 2035?
2. Would this get radio play?
3. Is this accessible to a broad audience?
4. Does this show through action/image or just tell?
5. Could this create licensing issues?

If the answer to any is problematic, flag appropriately and provide alternatives.
