# Meta Tags Comprehensive Reference

Meta tags are Suno's most powerful feature for granular control over song generation. This reference catalogs all effective meta tags organized by category.

## What Meta Tags Are

Meta tags are bracketed instructions embedded directly in your lyrics that tell Suno exactly how each section should sound. They function as inline formatting codes that override the global style prompt for specific sections.

**Basic structure:**
```
[Chorus | anthemic chorus | stacked harmonies | modern pop polish]
```

**Stacking with pipes:**
```
[Guitar Solo | 80s glam metal lead guitar | heavy distortion | wide stereo | whammy bar bends]
```

More specifications = more control. Meta tags should be placed at the beginning of each section in your lyrics field.

## Song Structure Tags

These form the foundation and should always be present in your lyrics:

- `[Intro]` - Opening section that establishes mood and prepares the listener
- `[Verse]` - Main narrative section that tells the story or develops themes
- `[Verse 1]` - First verse (numbered verses useful for tracking)

- `[Chorus]` - Memorable, repeating hook section with the main message
- `[Chorus 1]` - First chorus (numbered choruses useful for tracking)
- `[Post-Chorus]` - Section immediately following chorus, often reinforcing the hook
- `[Bridge]` - Contrasting section providing relief from repetition
- `[Build]` - Gradually increasing intensity leading to a climactic moment
- `[Drop]` - Sudden shift to maximum energy, common in electronic music
- `[Breakdown]` - Stripped-down section with reduced instrumentation
- `[Instrumental Break]` - Section without vocals featuring instrumental performance
- `[Solo Section]` - Spotlight on a single instrument's improvised or composed solo
- `[Outro]` - Closing section that resolves and ends the song

## Usage Guidelines

### Basic Meta Tag Usage

Place meta tags at the beginning of each section in your lyrics:

```
[Verse 1]
Lyrics here

[Chorus | anthemic chorus | stacked harmonies]
Lyrics here
```

### Advanced Stacking

Combine multiple descriptors with pipe separators:

```
[Intro | atmospheric pads | slow build | reverb-heavy | mysterious]

[Verse 1 | intimate vocals | fingerpicked guitar | minimal drums]

[Chorus | explosive energy | distorted guitars | powerful vocals | wide stereo]

[Bridge | stripped down | piano only | whispered vocals | no drums]

[Guitar Solo | 80s shred style | heavy distortion | whammy bar | fast arpeggios]
```

### Section-Specific Control

Different sections can have radically different production:

```
[Verse | lo-fi | tape hiss | narrow stereo | raw]
Verse lyrics

[Chorus | hi-fi | crystal clarity | wide stereo | polished]
Chorus lyrics
```

### Remastering Tags

Add to displayed lyrics before hitting Remaster:

```
[high_fidelity]
[studio_mix]
[analog_warmth]
[vocal_depth]
[punchy_dynamics]
```

## Summary

Meta tags provide unprecedented control over Suno's generation process. Effective usage:

1. Always include structure tags (`[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, etc.)
2. Stack multiple descriptors with pipes for precision
3. Place tags at the beginning of sections in lyrics
4. Use section-specific tags to create dynamic contrast
5. Combine production, mood, and instrumental tags
6. Reference this guide when building complex arrangements

Meta tags transform generic outputs into professional, intentional productions with precise control over every aspect of the song.
