# Realism Descriptors for Acoustic Music

Words like "realistic" are weak descriptors that Suno often ignores. **Descriptors of physical reality** are strong and produce actual results. This reference provides comprehensive technical vocabulary for achieving authentic acoustic sound.

## Core Principle

Avoid abstract vibes like "realistic," "authentic," or "natural." Instead, use **recording-engineer language** that describes actual physical characteristics of how sound is captured and produced. The more specific and technical your descriptors, the more Suno understands what you actually want.

## Acoustic Realism Descriptors

### Room Acoustics

**Small room acoustics**
- Describes intimate space with short reverberation time
- Creates closeness and presence
- Eliminates large hall ambience

**Room tone**
- Subtle ambient noise present in all real recordings
- Includes air movement, faint hiss, environmental sounds
- Provides "livingness" to the recording

**Small-bedroom acoustics**
- Very intimate, close-walled environment
- Natural dampening from furniture and materials
- Characteristic of lo-fi and bedroom pop

**Natural room sound**
- Organic reflections from real space
- Unprocessed acoustic environment
- No artificial reverb added

### Microphone Characteristics

**Close mic presence**
- Microphone positioned very near the sound source
- Captures intimate detail and reduces room reflections
- Provides proximity and directness

**Off-axis mic placement**
- Microphone positioned at an angle to the source
- Softens harsh frequencies naturally
- Creates more natural, less direct tone

**Proximity effect**
- Extra low-end frequency boost from close miking
- Natural bass emphasis without EQ
- Characteristic of directional microphones up close

**Single-mic capture**
- One microphone recording the entire performance
- Mono or simple stereo image
- Authentic to vintage and minimalist recording

**Multi-mic setup**
- Multiple microphones capturing different perspectives
- More complex but potentially more realistic
- Common in professional studio recordings

### Performance Characteristics

**One-take performance**
- Continuous recording without editing
- Natural flow and timing variations
- Includes all human imperfections

**Natural timing drift**
- Subtle human micro-rubato and timing variations
- Not locked to a grid or click track
- Breathes organically like live performance

**Natural dynamics**
- Organic volume variations throughout performance
- No brickwall limiting or heavy compression
- Preserves dynamic range and expression

**Human micro-rubato**
- Tiny tempo variations that humans naturally introduce
- Creates living, breathing quality
- Prevents mechanical feeling

### Breath and Body Detail

**Breath detail**
- Audible inhales and exhales between phrases
- Natural breathing patterns of the performer

**Mouth noise**
- Subtle lip noise, saliva clicks, tongue movements
- Captures intimate vocal detail
- Enhances realism of close-miked vocals

**Body shift**
- Sounds of performer moving or adjusting position

## Complete Acoustic Prompt Example

Here's how to combine these descriptors for maximum realism:

```
genre: "acoustic folk, intimate bedroom recording, singer-songwriter"

vocal: "baritone male with natural vibrato, gentle delivery, breath detail, slight vocal fry on low notes"

instrumentation: "single fingerpicked acoustic guitar, natural string resonance, fret squeak, pick noise, one-take performance"

recording: "single-source path, one person one guitar, small-bedroom acoustics, close mic presence, proximity effect, room tone, natural dynamics"

production: "authentic take, tape recorder, close-up, raw performance texture, handheld device realism, narrow mono image, unpolished, dry, minimal reverb, natural room sound"

realism: "small room acoustics, close mic presence, proximity effect, one-take performance, natural timing drift, natural dynamics, breath detail, pick noise, fret squeak, finger movement noise on strings, tape saturation, analog warmth, slight wow and flutter, limited stereo, short room reverb, early reflections emphasized, background noise floor consistent, imperfections kept"
```

## Electronic Music Counterpart

For electronic music, realism descriptors are counterproductive. Instead use:

**Synthesis descriptors:**
- FM synthesis bass
- Wavetable movement
- Formant-driven bass
- Granular textures
- Spectral morphing

**Motion descriptors:**
- Evolving modulation
- LFO-driven movement
- Dynamic harmonic motion
- Non-repeating bass cycles

**Production descriptors:**
- Sidechain compression
- Low-pass filter sweeps
- Phase-coherent low end
- Clean punch
- Controlled high end

## Genre-Dependent Application

### When to Use Realism Descriptors (ESSENTIAL)

- **Acoustic music** (folk, singer-songwriter)
- **Country** (traditional, outlaw, Americana)
- **Jazz** (intimate combo, small group)
- **Classical chamber music** (small ensemble)
- **Blues** (traditional, Delta, acoustic)
- **Unplugged arrangements** of any genre

### When to Skip Realism Descriptors (COUNTERPRODUCTIVE)

- **Electronic music** (house, techno, EDM)
- **Hip-hop** (trap, beats, modern production)
- **Synthwave** (retro electronic)
- **Metal** (heavily produced, modern)
- **Pop** (polished, modern production)

## MAX Mode Integration

MAX Mode parameters work synergistically with realism descriptors for acoustic music:

```
[Is_MAX_MODE: MAX](MAX)
[QUALITY: MAX](MAX)
[REALISM: MAX](MAX)
[REAL_INSTRUMENTS: MAX](MAX)

genre: "outlaw country, 70s singer-songwriter"

instruments: "single dreadnought acoustic, baritone male, vocal fry, blue notes, melismatic runs"

realism: "tape saturation, close-mic presence, small room acoustics, handheld mic grit, dry & raw, pick noise, fret squeak, natural timing drift, breath detail"
```

## Summary

Achieving authentic acoustic sound in Suno requires:

1. **Specific technical language**, not vague terms like "realistic"
2. **Recording engineer vocabulary** describing physical capture
3. **Stacking multiple descriptors** for cumulative effect
4. **Genre-appropriate application** (acoustic genres only)
5. **Integration with MAX Mode** for acoustic music
6. **Avoiding electronic/modern descriptors** that conflict

The difference between mediocre and professional acoustic AI music is understanding this technical vocabulary and applying it systematically. Use this reference to build comprehensive realism stacks that produce genuinely convincing acoustic recordings.
