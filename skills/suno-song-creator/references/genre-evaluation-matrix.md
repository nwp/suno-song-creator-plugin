# Genre Evaluation Matrix

Quick-reference comparison table for applying different evaluation criteria across musical genres.

## Purpose

This matrix helps the quality-reviewer adapt evaluation standards based on genre. What's CRITICAL in one genre may be ACCEPTABLE or even ENCOURAGED in another.

## How to Use This Matrix

1. Identify the primary genre from the song context
2. Look up specific criteria in the tables below
3. Apply severity ratings (CRITICAL / SUGGESTED / OPTIONAL / ACCEPTABLE)
4. Cross-reference with detailed genre guides when needed

## Core Evaluation Criteria by Genre

### Brand Names & Product References

| Genre | Brand Names | Severity | Why |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----|
| **Pop** | ❌ Avoid all | CRITICAL | Licensing issues, dates song, commercial feel |
| **Indie/Folk** | ✅ If authentic | ACCEPTABLE | Grounds story, adds authenticity |
| **Country** | ✅ If authentic | ACCEPTABLE | Real people have real brands, character detail |
| **Electronic/EDM** | ⚠️ Depends | SUGGESTED | Minimal lyrics, focus on vibe not brands |
| **Rock** | ⚠️ Depends | SUGGESTED | Can work if rebellious/anti-commercial angle |

## Quick Decision Trees

### "Should I flag this brand name?"

```
Is genre Pop or Electronic?
└─ YES → ❌ CRITICAL (flag immediately)
└─ NO → Continue...
    Does brand feel authentic to character?
    └─ YES → ✅ ACCEPTABLE
    └─ NO → ⚠️ SUGGESTED (flag as commercial/forced)
```

### "Is this line too wordy?"

```
Count words in line:
├─ Electronic: >8 words → CRITICAL
├─ Pop: >10 words → SUGGESTED, >12 → CRITICAL
├─ Rock: >11 words → SUGGESTED, >14 → CRITICAL
├─ Country/R&B: >12 words → SUGGESTED, >15 → CRITICAL
└─ Indie/Folk/Singer-Songwriter: >15 words → SUGGESTED, >18 → CRITICAL

BUT if wordiness serves narrative depth in Indie/Folk → OK even if higher
```

### "Is this contemporary reference acceptable?"

```
Will this reference work in 5 years?
├─ NO → Continue...
│   ├─ Genre is Pop? → ❌ CRITICAL
│   ├─ Genre is Hip-Hop/Indie? → ⚠️ SUGGESTED (note trade-off)
│   └─ Genre is Country/Rock? → ⚠️ SUGGESTED
└─ YES → ✅ ACCEPTABLE
```

### "Is this telling vs. showing OK?"

```
Line explicitly states emotion/dynamic?
└─ YES → Continue...
    ├─ Genre is Pop/Electronic? → ⚠️ SUGGESTED (push for showing)
    ├─ Genre is Indie/Folk/Singer-Songwriter? → ✅ ACCEPTABLE
    ├─ Genre is R&B? → ✅ ACCEPTABLE
    └─ Genre is Rock/Country/Hip-Hop? → ⚠️ OPTIONAL (note, but don't push hard)
```

## Sub-Genre Variations

### Pop Sub-Genres

| Sub-Genre | Key Differences |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Bubblegum Pop** | Even more compressed (5-7 words/line), maximum catchiness, lighter topics |
| **Pop-Rock** | Slightly wordier OK (up to 10 words), more raw emotion, anthemic |
| **Electro-Pop** | Minimal lyrics (4-6 words), vibe over narrative, repetition essential |
| **R&B-Pop** | More telling OK (50/50), vocal runs, moderate wordiness (8-10) |
| **Indie-Pop** | Blend: catchiness + authenticity, 7-9 words, can use specific details |

### Rock Sub-Genres

| Sub-Genre | Key Differences |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Classic Rock** | Timeless required, avoid contemporary refs, anthemic choruses |
| **Punk** | Raw, direct, can be dated/political, short punchy lines |
| **Alternative** | More experimental, indie influences, authenticity valued |
| **Stadium Rock** | Anthemic, universal appeal, avoid specific details |
| **Indie Rock** | Blend with indie-folk rules, specificity OK, narrative depth |

### Electronic Sub-Genres

| Sub-Genre | Key Differences |
|-----------|----------------|
| **House/Techno** | Minimal vocals, repetition essential, vibe-only |
| **Dubstep** | Energy-focused, drops over lyrics, minimal OK |
| **Synthwave** | Can use "neon" imagery IF genre-appropriate, nostalgic 80s OK |
| **Chillwave** | Atmospheric, abstract OK, lo-fi aesthetic |

## Genre Blending

### When Song Crosses Genres:

**Example: Indie-Pop**

Use hybrid approach:
- ✅ Pop catchiness + indie authenticity
- ✅ Compressed but allow some narrative (7-9 words/line)
- ✅ Some specific details OK (not full indie level)
- ⚠️ Brand names: case-by-case
- ✅ Show/tell: 65/35 (between pop's 70/30 and indie's 50/50)

**Example: Country-Pop**

Use hybrid approach:
- ✅ Country storytelling + pop compression
- ✅ Place names OK, brand names caution
- ✅ Moderate wordiness (8-10 words)
- ✅ Show/tell: 65/35

**General Rule for Blends:**
- Identify primary genre (what's dominant?)
- Apply that genre's standards as baseline
- Allow secondary genre influences as OPTIONAL improvements

---

## Regional & Cultural Considerations

### Regional Vocabulary

**Accept regionally appropriate language:**
- Southern/Country: "y'all", "ain't", "holler"
- Urban/Hip-Hop: AAVE, regional slang
- British: "mate", "lorry", "flat"
- Australian: "arvo", "servo", "fair dinkum"

**Don't flag as "grammatically incorrect" if authentic to speaker's voice.**

### Cultural References

**Consider cultural context:**
- Hip-Hop: Black cultural references expected/required
- Country: Rural/Southern cultural touchstones
- Punk: Anti-establishment, counter-culture
- Folk: Labor, social justice themes

**Don't flag cultural specificity as "limiting appeal" - it's genre authenticity.**
