# Indie/Folk Music Evaluation Guide

Specialized evaluation criteria for indie and folk music, focusing on authenticity, narrative depth, and artistic vision over commercial considerations.

## Overview

Indie/folk evaluation operates on fundamentally different principles than pop. What fails in pop (brand names, wordiness, explicit statements) often **succeeds in indie/folk** because:
- Authenticity > commercial viability
- Narrative depth > compression
- Specificity creates grounded, believable stories
- Artistic vision > broad accessibility
- Timelessness comes from emotional truth, not avoiding references

**Key Philosophy:** Indie/folk prioritizes **concrete authenticity** over **universal abstraction**.

---

## 1. Specificity Rules for Indie/Folk

### The Authenticity Principle

Indie/folk thrives on **specific, grounded details** that make stories feel real. Brand names, place names, and concrete objects anchor narratives in believable reality.

### ✅ ACCEPTABLE & ENCOURAGED

**Brand Names (When Authentic):**
- ✅ "your Volvo" (character detail)
- ✅ "Costco parking lot" (specific setting)
- ✅ "Converse sneakers" (visual detail)
- ✅ "Levi jeans" (texture, authenticity)
- ✅ "Honda Civic" (specific, relatable)

**Why acceptable in indie/folk:**
1. **Authenticity** - Real people have real stuff with brand names
2. **Specificity** - Grounds story in believable reality
3. **Character development** - "Volvo" says something different than "car"
4. **No commercial pressure** - Indie/folk doesn't prioritize radio play

**Test: Does it feel authentic or forced?**
- ✅ Authentic: Brand emerges naturally from character/setting
- ❌ Forced: Brand name seems like product placement

### ✅ ENCOURAGED SPECIFICITY

**Place Names:**
- ✅ "Seattle coffee shops"
- ✅ "Brooklyn brownstone"
- ✅ "Highway 101"
- ✅ "The river by Main Street"
- ✅ "Wisconsin winter"

**Specific Objects:**
- ✅ "your grandfather's watch"
- ✅ "thrifted denim jacket"
- ✅ "coffee-stained notebook"
- ✅ "acoustic guitar with the broken string"

**Concrete Sensory Details:**
- ✅ "smell of pine and rain"
- ✅ "sound of gravel under tires"
- ✅ "taste of cheap red wine"
- ✅ "cold tile floor"

### ⚠️ WHEN TO FLAG (Rare)

**Only flag brand names if:**
- Feels like product placement (multiple brands in quick succession)
- Sounds commercial rather than authentic
- Doesn't serve character/narrative
- Pulled from trending products (not authentic to character)

**Example of problematic use:**
```
❌ "Sippin' Starbucks in my Tesla
    Wearing Gucci, feelin' fresh, uh
    iPhone buzzing, Rolex shining"
```
(Too many brands, sounds commercial, not indie/folk voice)

**Example of good use:**
```
✅ "Found your father's Carhartt jacket
    In the back of the Volvo
    Still smells like sawdust and October"
```
(Brands serve character/memory, authentic voice)

---

## 2. Contemporary References & Timelessness

### Authenticity Over Timelessness

In indie/folk, it's ACCEPTABLE to date your song if it captures an authentic moment in time.

### ✅ ACCEPTABLE - Cultural Specificity

**Specific Years/Eras:**
- ✅ "2020 felt like drowning"
- ✅ "We met in '09"
- ✅ "That summer of the wildfires"
- ✅ "Pandemic loneliness"

**Why acceptable:**
- Grounds story in specific time
- Emotional truth > timelessness
- Nostalgia and specificity are values

**Tech References (Contextual):**
- ✅ "Found your old mixtape" (evokes era)
- ✅ "Scrolling through photos at 2am" (contemporary loneliness)
- ✅ "Your Instagram posts from that summer" (modern storytelling tool)

### ⚠️ SUGGESTED - When References Feel Trendy

**Flag if:**
- Using current slang just to sound current ("rizz", "lowkey highkey")
- Reference feels forced to be "relatable"
- Trend-chasing rather than authentic voice

**Test:**
- Does this feel like the character's natural language?
- Or does it feel like trying to sound young/current?

### Timelessness in Indie/Folk

**Comes from:**
- ✅ Emotional truth (heartbreak, longing, loss transcends eras)
- ✅ Universal human experiences told through specific details
- ✅ Archetypal stories with concrete grounding

**Not from:**
- ❌ Avoiding all contemporary references
- ❌ Using only generic language
- ❌ Sacrificing authenticity for broad appeal

---

## 3. Wordiness & Narrative Flow

### Narrative Depth Over Compression

Indie/folk allows (even encourages) longer, more narrative lines because **storytelling is the priority**.

### ✅ ACCEPTABLE Word Counts

**Verses:**
- ✅ 10-12 words per line acceptable
- ✅ Can go to 14-15 if serves narrative flow
- ✅ Variation between lines creates natural speech rhythm

**Chorus:**
- ✅ 8-10 words acceptable
- ✅ Can be shorter (5-7) for contrast
- ✅ Repetition serves meditation, not just catchiness

**Bridge:**
- ✅ Wordcount can expand here (12-15 words)
- ✅ Bridge is narrative revelation, allows complexity

### ✅ EXAMPLES OF GOOD WORDINESS

```
✅ "I found your father's Carhartt jacket in the back of the Volvo" (12 words)
✅ "The smell of pine and rain reminds me of that October" (11 words)
✅ "You talked about leaving but your roots were too deep" (10 words)
```

**Why these work:**
- Serve narrative depth
- Create specific images
- Natural speech patterns
- Don't feel rushed or crammed

### ⚠️ ONLY FLAG IF CLUNKY

**Flag wordiness when:**
- Line is grammatically awkward
- Too many clauses create confusion
- Loses natural speech rhythm
- Feels padded rather than purposeful

**Example of problematic wordiness:**
```
❌ "I remember when we used to, you know, like, go to that place where we would always, um, hang out together back in the day"
(Filler words, meandering, no purpose)
```

**Example of purposeful wordiness:**
```
✅ "I remember the diner on Route 9 where we'd split coffee and talk till dawn"
(13 words, but every word serves imagery/memory)
```

## 4. Show vs. Tell Balance

### Telling is Acceptable in Storytelling Context

Indie/folk operates on a **50/50 show/tell ratio** (vs. pop's 70/30).

### ✅ WHEN TELLING WORKS

**Direct Emotional Statements:**
- ✅ "I'm in love with the way you laugh"
- ✅ "I'm afraid of losing this"
- ✅ "I'm tired of pretending I'm fine"

**Why acceptable:**
- Confessional intimacy is indie/folk strength
- Listeners connect with raw honesty
- Not trying to be cryptic

**Explicit Relationship Dynamics:**
- ✅ "You're the reason I can't leave this town"
- ✅ "I know I'm holding you back"
- ✅ "We're both too stubborn to walk away"

**Why acceptable:**
- Self-awareness is characteristic of genre
- Introspection > implication
- Emotional maturity in acknowledging dynamics

### ✅ STILL USE SHOWING

**Balance with concrete imagery:**
```
✅ "I'm afraid of losing this (TELLING)
    The way your hand fits in mine (SHOWING)
    The sound of your laugh in the kitchen (SHOWING)
    The quiet mornings, the late-night talks (SHOWING)"
```

**Best practice:**
- Tell the emotion
- Show the evidence
- Ground abstract feelings in concrete moments

### ⚠️ ONLY FLAG EXCESSIVE TELLING

**Flag when:**
- Entire song is abstract statements with no concrete images
- Feels like therapy session transcript without narrative
- Over-intellectualizes without grounding

---

## 5. Indie/Folk Best Practices

### Storytelling & Narrative Arc

**Strong indie/folk songs have:**
- ✅ Clear narrative throughline
- ✅ Character development or emotional journey
- ✅ Specific setting/time/place
- ✅ Concrete details that accumulate meaning

**Structure:**
- Verses: Build narrative with details
- Chorus: Emotional thesis/refrain
- Bridge: Revelation, shift in perspective
- Ending: Resolution or meaningful ambiguity

### Authentic Voice

**Prioritize:**
- ✅ Natural speech patterns (not forced rhymes)
- ✅ Conversational tone (can break grammar rules)
- ✅ Regional/personal vocabulary
- ✅ Honest, unpolished emotion

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Trying to sound "poetic" unnaturally
- ❌ Forcing rhymes at expense of meaning
- ❌ Vocabulary that doesn't match character's voice

### Grounded Imagery

**Use:**
- ✅ Sensory details (smell, touch, taste, sound)
- ✅ Physical objects with history
- ✅ Weather, seasons, landscapes
- ✅ Domestic/everyday moments

**Example:**
```
✅ "Coffee-stained notebook on the table
    Your handwriting in the margins
    Underlined the parts about leaving
    But you're still here come morning"
```

## 6. Rhyme Schemes in Indie/Folk

### Loose, Natural Rhyming

Indie/folk prioritizes **meaning over rhyme**.

### ✅ ACCEPTABLE Rhyme Approaches

**Slant Rhymes:**
- ✅ "home/alone" (different vowel sounds, but close)
- ✅ "leave/breathe"
- ✅ "car/far"

**Sporadic Rhyming:**
- ✅ ABCB (only 2nd and 4th lines rhyme)
- ✅ ABAC (minimal rhyming)
- ✅ Free verse sections (especially bridge)

**Internal Rhymes:**
- ✅ "The cold wind reminds me of your cold shoulder"

### ⚠️ FLAG FORCED RHYMES

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Rhyming at expense of natural language
- ❌ Awkward word order to achieve rhyme
- ❌ Sacrificing meaning for perfect rhyme

**Example of forced:**
```
❌ "Your love to me you did give
    And together we could live"
```
(Archaic phrasing for rhyme)

**Better (natural language, slant rhyme):**
```
✅ "You gave me something to believe in
    A reason to keep breathing"
```

## 7. Common Indie/Folk Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Overdoing the Aesthetic

**Problematic pattern:**
```
❌ "Flannel shirts and vinyl records
    Coffee shops and autumn leaves
    Acoustic guitars and handwritten letters
    Vintage cameras, faded Polaroids"
```

**Why problematic:**
- Checklist of indie aesthetic, not authentic details
- Feels generic "indie" rather than specific character
- Cliché accumulation

**Fix:**
- Choose 1-2 specific details that matter to the story
- Ground aesthetic elements in character's actual life

### Pitfall 2: Vagueness Masquerading as Poetry

**Problematic:**
```
❌ "Lost in the echoes of yesterday's dreams
    Fragments of memories fading like mist
    Shadows of who we used to be
    Drifting through the void of time"
```

**Why problematic:**
- All abstractions, no concrete grounding
- Could be about anything
- Loses narrative specificity

**Fix:**
```
✅ "I found your mixtape in the glovebox
    Songs we played driving to the coast
    Wanted to throw it away
    But I'm listening to it now"
```

### Pitfall 3: Over-Intellectualizing

**Problematic:**
```
❌ "The existential weight of our inevitable separation
    Manifests in the quotidian moments we ignore
    A phenomenological understanding of our disconnect"
```

**Why problematic:**
- Vocabulary doesn't match conversational folk voice
- Sounds academic, not emotional
- Alienates rather than connects

**Fix:**
```
✅ "We're falling apart in small ways
    The things we don't say over breakfast
    The way you're always almost leaving"
```

### Pitfall 4: All Setting, No Story

**Problematic:**
```
❌ Entire song describing a location with no narrative
```

**Fix:**
- Use setting to frame a story or emotional journey
- Setting should reveal character or relationship
- Balance description with action/development

## 8. Genre-Specific Subcategories

### Traditional Folk

**Emphasize:**
- Narrative storytelling (verse-driven)
- Historical or archetypal stories
- Simple, direct language
- Natural speech patterns
- Acoustic, unadorned

### Indie Folk (Contemporary)

**Allow:**
- Contemporary references
- Modern instrumentation descriptors
- Urban settings alongside rural
- Personal, confessional narratives
- Experimental structures

### Singer-Songwriter

**Emphasize:**
- First-person confessional
- Autobiographical authenticity
- Introspective self-awareness
- Emotional vulnerability
- Can be more "telling" (60% show/40% tell acceptable)

### Americana/Alt-Country

**Allow:**
- Place-specific references (Southern, Midwest, etc.)
- Regional dialects/vocabulary
- Rural imagery
- Specific cultural touchstones
- Brand names common in that culture (trucks, tools, etc.)

---

## 9. Evaluation Workflow for Indie/Folk Songs

### Step 1: Authenticity Check

**Ask:**
- Does this feel like a real person's authentic voice?
- Or does it feel like "indie aesthetic cosplay"?
- Are details specific to a character/story or generic "indie" imagery?

### Step 2: Narrative Coherence

**Check:**
- Is there a clear story or emotional arc?
- Do details accumulate to reveal character/relationship?
- Does the song go somewhere (development, revelation, resolution)?

### Step 3: Concrete vs. Abstract Balance

**Calculate:**
- Ratio of concrete images to abstract statements
- Target: 60% concrete, 40% abstract (minimum)
- Flag if too abstract/vague

### Step 4: Voice Consistency

**Assess:**
- Does vocabulary match the character's voice?
- Is phrasing natural or forced?
- Do word choices feel authentic to speaker?

### Step 5: Wordiness Assessment

**Only flag if:**
- Lines are grammatically clunky
- Wordiness serves no narrative purpose
- Natural speech rhythm is lost

**Don't flag for:**
- Longer lines that serve storytelling
- Variation in line length for rhythm
- Narrative detail accumulation

## 10. When to Flag in Indie/Folk

### FLAG AS CRITICAL

1. **Generic indie aesthetic checklist** (flannel, vinyl, coffee, no grounding)
2. **All abstractions, no concrete details**
3. **Voice doesn't match vocabulary** (too academic/formal)
4. **No narrative arc** (just vague vibes)
5. **Forced rhymes breaking natural language**

### FLAG AS SUGGESTED

1. **Could benefit from more specific details**
2. **Slightly too wordy in a clunky way** (not narrative purpose)
3. **Contemporary reference feels trend-chasing**
4. **Brand name feels forced/commercial**

### DON'T FLAG

1. **Brand names if authentic to character**
2. **Place names (almost always good)**
3. **Wordiness if serves narrative**
4. **Direct emotional statements** (telling is OK)
5. **Dated references if authentic to time period**
6. **Slant rhymes or loose rhyme schemes**
7. **Conversational grammar "errors"**

---

## 11. Recommended Vocabulary & Imagery

### Nature & Landscape
- trees, rivers, mountains, fields, sky
- seasons (autumn heavily used, but authentic)
- weather (rain, snow, wind, storms)
- specific flora/fauna of region

### Domestic & Everyday
- coffee, kitchens, porches, bedrooms
- objects with history (inherited, thrifted, worn)
- routines and rituals
- small moments of domesticity

### Travel & Movement
- roads, highways, rivers, trains
- cars (often with specific details)
- migration, leaving, returning
- specific place names

### Memory & Time
- photographs, letters, belongings
- seasons as time markers
- specific years or eras
- aging and change

## 12. Final Checklist

Before approving indie/folk lyrics, verify:

- [ ] **Specific, concrete details** ground the narrative
- [ ] **Authentic voice** (not trying to sound "indie")
- [ ] **Narrative arc or emotional journey** present
- [ ] **Balance of concrete imagery** (60%+) **and emotional truth**
- [ ] **Natural speech patterns** (conversational, not forced poetic)
- [ ] **Details serve character/story**, not just aesthetic
- [ ] **If brand/place names used, they feel authentic** not commercial
- [ ] **Wordiness serves narrative depth**, not padding
- [ ] **Rhyme scheme is natural**, not forced
- [ ] **Emotional honesty** over cleverness

---

## Summary

**Indie/folk evaluation is about authenticity over polish:**
- **Specific over generic** - "your Volvo" is better than "your car"
- **Narrative depth over compression** - 12-word lines OK if they serve story
- **Emotional honesty over implication** - Telling is acceptable
- **Natural speech over perfect rhyme** - Meaning > formal structure
- **Grounded truth over broad appeal** - Not writing for radio

**When evaluating indie/folk, ask:**
1. Does this feel authentic to a real person's voice?
2. Is there a narrative or emotional journey?
3. Are there enough concrete details to ground the story?
4. Is the language natural or forced?
5. Do details serve the character/story or just aesthetic?

**Remember:** What fails in pop often succeeds in indie/folk. Brand names, place names, wordiness, and explicit emotional statements are STRENGTHS when used authentically.
