## Lyrics with Meta Tags

```
///*****///

[Intro | atmospheric pads | slow build | reverb-heavy | no vocals]

[Verse 1 | sparse vocals | minimal beat | filtered synths]
Digital shadows in neon light
(neon light, neon light)
Running through the endless night
System override

[Build | rising energy | filter sweep | increased tempo feel]
Feel the pressure rising up
(rising up, rising up)
Can't stop, won't stop
Feel the drop

[Drop | explosive energy | 808 sub bass | sidechain compression | wide stereo]
[Instrumental - heavy bass, arpeggiated leads, punchy drums]

[Verse 2 | robotic vocals | vocode effect | glitch elements]
Chrome and wire, electric veins
(electric veins)
Breaking through the digital chains
No escape

[Build | building energy | riser effects | tension increase]
FEEL THE PRESSURE RISING UP
(RISING UP, RISING UP)
CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP
FEEL THE DROP

[Drop | maximum energy | layered synths | heavy distortion | wall of sound]
[Instrumental - full production, all elements, intense]

[Bridge | breakdown | stripped minimal | just pads and vocal]
(in the night... in the night...)
We become electric
(electric... electric...)

[Final Build | extreme tension | all risers | prepare for climax]
PRESSURE RISING
CAN'T STOP NOW
FEEL THE DROP

[Final Drop | explosive climax | all elements | maximum intensity]
[Instrumental - everything, loudest section, epic finale]

[Outro | fading energy | reverb tails | atmospheric decay]
(neon light... fading out...)
```

## Notes on This Prompt

### Why This Works

1. **No MAX Mode** - Skipped because it's ineffective for electronic music
2. **Synthesis-focused descriptors** - FM, wavetable, LFO-driven instead of vague "big bass"
3. **Anti-sawtooth strategy** - Explicitly avoids generic sawtooth synths through harmonic control
4. **Exclude acoustics** - Removes organic instruments that would pollute electronic sound
5. **Production architecture** - Sidechain, filter sweeps, stereo width, wall of sound
6. **Higher weirdness** - 60-70% encourages creative electronic territory
7. **Meta tags for dynamics** - Clear progression from atmospheric intro to explosive drops
8. **Electronic vocal treatment** - Autotune, vocode, robotic processing specified
9. **Build-drop structure** - Classic EDM arrangement with proper tension and release
10. **Dark aesthetic** - Consistent cyberpunk/synthwave theme throughout

### Anti-Sawtooth Techniques Applied

Notice how the prompt redirects away from generic saws:

**Instead of:** "big bass, heavy synths"

**Uses:**
- "FM and wavetable bass design" - Specific synthesis types
- "Rounded harmonic profile" - Shapes harmonics to avoid saw
- "Evolving modulation patterns" - Describes motion instead of size
- "Dynamic harmonic motion with spectral morphing" - Complex, changing sound
- "Controlled high harmonics, smooth top end" - Manages brightness
- "Non-repeating bass cycles" - Forces variety

This combination makes it nearly impossible for Suno to default to boring sawtooth synths.

### Production Architecture

Electronic music requires different language than acoustic:

**Motion descriptors:**
- "LFO-driven movement creating rhythmic interest"
- "Evolving modulation patterns that change over time"
- "Dynamic harmonic motion with spectral morphing"

**Spatial descriptors:**
- "Wide stereo image with separated elements"
- "Phase-coherent low end"
- "Ping-pong delay"

**Processing descriptors:**
- "Sidechain compression creating rhythmic pumping"
- "Low-pass filter sweeps during builds"
- "Resonant bandpass filters with frequency sweeps"

### Genre Cloud Management

This prompt escapes the dark electronic → generic EDM trap by:

1. Being very specific: "Dark synthwave with cyberpunk aesthetic, darksynth intensity and aggressive energy"
2. Excluding acoustics that would soften the sound
3. Emphasizing specific 80s influences while keeping modern production
4. Using scene/era descriptors to anchor the sound (darksynth subgenre, 1980s film soundtracks)
5. Describing synthesis methods, not just genre names

### Meta Tag Strategy for EDM

Electronic music has different structural needs:

- **Intro:** Atmospheric, building, no vocals
- **Verse:** Sparse, minimal beat (vocal sections lighter)
- **Build:** Rising energy, filter sweeps, risers, tension
- **Drop:** Explosive, maximum elements, heavy bass, instrumental
- **Bridge:** Breakdown, stripped, minimal (provides contrast)
- **Final Build:** Extreme tension before climax
- **Final Drop:** Everything, loudest, epic
- **Outro:** Fading, decay, resolution

This creates the tension-and-release structure essential to EDM.

### Vocal Treatment

Electronic vocals need specific processing:

```
vocal: "male baritone with autotune processing, modern electronic vocal treatment, robotic character, vocode effect on chorus, sparse vocal presence"
```

**Key elements:**
- Autotune processing specified
- Robotic character (not human naturalism)
- Vocode effect for chorus sections
- Sparse presence (not vocal-forward)

Plus exclude: `Acoustic, Natural Vocals, Organic Delivery`

## Expected Result

When properly executed, this prompt should produce:
- Dark, cyberpunk-influenced synthwave sound
- Complex, evolving bass that isn't generic sawtooth
- Wide, professional stereo image
- Proper build-and-drop EDM structure
- Sidechain pumping on bass during drops
- Processed, robotic vocals (not natural)
- Modern, punchy production
- No acoustic or organic elements

## Common Issues and Fixes

**Issue:** Generic sawtooth synths appearing
**Fix:** Strengthen anti-sawtooth descriptors, add more synthesis detail, exclude "Generic Synths"

**Issue:** Vocals too natural/human
**Fix:** Add "heavy autotune, robotic processing, vocode effect", exclude "Natural Vocals"

**Issue:** Muddy, unclear bass
**Fix:** Emphasize "phase-coherent low end, clean punch, sub-driven design"

**Issue:** Not enough energy in drops
**Fix:** Add "wall of sound, maximum layering, explosive energy" to drop meta tags

**Issue:** Too much acoustic bleed
**Fix:** Strengthen exclusions, add "no organic instruments, fully electronic"

## Variations

### For Instrumental-Only Version

Remove all vocal references and add:
```
Exclude Styles: Vocals, Singing, Melodic Vocals, Any Vocals

instrumentation: "focus on instrumental layering and melodic lead synths, no vocal elements"
```

### For Lighter, More Uplifting EDM

Change mood section:
```
mood: "euphoric and uplifting, summer festival energy, positive vibes, bright and energetic, celebratory atmosphere"

genre: "progressive house, uplifting EDM, festival anthem"
```

### For More Aggressive Sound

Add to production:
```
production: "heavy distortion on leads, aggressive compression, industrial edge, harsh transients, raw energy"

genre: "industrial techno, hard techno, aggressive electronic"
```

### For Retro 80s Purity

Adjust synthesis:
```
synthesis: "authentic 1980s synthesis, vintage Roland and Moog character, analog imperfections, period-correct production"

production: "1980s mixing aesthetic, gated reverb, vintage mastering, less modern polish"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Sidechain Timing

For precise rhythmic control:
```
production: "sidechain compression timed to kick drum, creating rhythmic pumping effect on bass and pads, four-on-the-floor groove"
```

### Filter Automation

For dynamic movement:
```
production: "low-pass filter sweeps during build sections, opening from dark to bright, resonant bandpass movement creating tension, filter automation following melodic contour"
```

### Stereo Width Control

For spatial precision:
```
production: "bass and kick centered in mono, lead synths wide in stereo, pads extremely wide creating space, hi-hats panned dynamically, stereo separation by frequency range"
```

This example demonstrates complete application of advanced Suno prompting techniques for professional electronic music generation, focusing on synthesis control, anti-generic strategies, and proper EDM production architecture.
