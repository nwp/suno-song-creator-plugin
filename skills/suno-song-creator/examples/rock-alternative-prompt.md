## Model Selection

**Recommended:** v4.5 (reliable for heavier genres)
**Alternative:** v5 (if you want cleaner vocals, but watch for pop drift)

## Parameters

**MAX Mode:** OPTIONAL (helps with organic drums and guitar, but not essential)
**Weirdness:** 40-50% (balanced creativity with genre adherence)
**Style Influence:** 70-80% (strong adherence to counter pop gravity)
**Vocal Gender:** Male
**Exclude Styles:** Pop, Electronic, Hip Hop, Polished Pop Production, Clean Pop Vocals

## Prompt Style (Structured Format)

```
genre: "alternative rock with post-grunge elements and 90s aesthetic, raw energy, introspective yet anthemic, Pacific Northwest grunge influence with melodic sensibility, guitar-driven with emotional depth"

vocal: "male baritone with gritty texture, emotional intensity ranging from intimate verses to powerful belted choruses, slight rasp and vocal fry on low notes, raw delivery without excessive polish, grunge-era vulnerability with Seattle scene power and emotional rawness"

instrumentation: "electric guitar with power chords and melodic lead lines using tube amp overdrive and natural distortion, driving kick-snare rhythm with acoustic drums recorded live, bass guitar locked tight with kick drum providing foundation, rhythm guitar with thick power chord progression, lead guitar with expressive bends and sustain, sparse atmospheric elements in background"

```

## Lyrics with Meta Tags

```
///*****///

[Intro | distorted guitar riff | powerful drums | raw energy]

[Verse 1 | intimate vocals | clean guitar with light distortion | restrained drums]
Broken glass on the bedroom floor
Another night I can't take anymore
Screaming silence in my head
Choking on the words I never said

[Pre-Chorus | building intensity | distortion increasing | drums getting heavier]
And I'm trying to find my way
(find my way, find my way)
But the darkness pulls me back again

[Chorus | anthemic power | full distortion | powerful vocals | driving rhythm]
I'M BREAKING DOWN THESE WALLS TONIGHT
FIGHTING THROUGH THE PAIN TO FIND THE LIGHT
WON'T LET THIS DARKNESS WIN THE FIGHT
I'M BREAKING DOWN THESE WALLS TONIGHT

[Verse 2 | gritty vocals | power chords | locked bass and drums]
Your memory haunts these empty rooms
Fading photographs and broken tunes
I built these walls to keep me safe
But now they're just my prison gates

[Pre-Chorus | intensity rising | vocal strain showing emotion]
And I'm TRYING TO FIND MY WAY
(FIND MY WAY, FIND MY WAY)
But the darkness pulls me back again

[Chorus | explosive energy | all instruments | maximum power]
I'M BREAKING DOWN THESE WALLS TONIGHT
FIGHTING THROUGH THE PAIN TO FIND THE LIGHT
WON'T LET THIS DARKNESS WIN THE FIGHT
I'M BREAKING DOWN THESE WALLS TONIGHT

[Bridge | stripped down | clean guitar arpeggios | vulnerable vocals]
(let it go, let it go)
Maybe if I let you go
I could find myself again
(find myself, find myself)
Maybe there's still time to heal

[Guitar Solo | 90s alternative style | melodic with emotion | tube overdrive | expressive bends]

[Final Chorus | cathartic climax | raw power | emotional release | all elements]
I'M BREAKING DOWN THESE WALLS TONIGHT
(breaking down, breaking down)
FIGHTING THROUGH THE PAIN TO FIND THE LIGHT
(find the light, find the light)
WON'T LET THIS DARKNESS WIN THE FIGHT
I'M BREAKING DOWN THESE WALLS TONIGHT

[Outro | powerful guitar outro | drums driving | fading with feedback]
(tonight... tonight...)
Breaking down these walls
```

## Notes on This Prompt

### Why This Works

1. **Strong exclusions** - Explicitly removes pop (315B link gravity well), electronic, hip hop
2. **High style influence** - 70-80% forces adherence despite rock's pop associations
3. **Scene/era descriptors** - Pacific Northwest grunge, Seattle scene, 90s alternative rock
4. **90s aesthetic specified** - Temporal anchor escapes modern pop-rock sound
5. **Raw production emphasized** - "Without excessive polish" counteracts pop production
6. **Full band arrangement** - Emphasizes organic, live performance over produced tracks
7. **Attitude descriptors** - "Raw energy, introspective, angst" define rock character
8. **Guitar-driven emphasis** - Makes guitar the hero, not pop hooks
9. **Proper vocal arc** - Intimate verses → powerful choruses (classic rock dynamic)
10. **Meta tags create dynamics** - Clear progression from restrained to explosive

### Managing Rock → Pop Gravity (315 Billion Links!)

This is the most critical challenge. The prompt counters it through:

**Explicit exclusions:**
```
Exclude Styles: Pop, Electronic, Hip Hop, Polished Pop Production, Clean Pop Vocals
```

**Raw production descriptors:**
- "Raw energy without excessive polish"
- "Live recording quality"
- "Authentic rock mixing"
- "Analog warmth without digital perfection"
- "Minimal overdubs"

**90s temporal anchor:**
- "90s aesthetic"
- "Post-grunge elements"
- "Pacific Northwest grunge influence"
- "Seattle scene power and vulnerability"

**Genre-specific details:**
- "Power chords" (not pop chord progressions)
- "Tube amp overdrive" (not clean pop guitars)
- "Gritty texture" (not pop vocal polish)
- "Raw delivery" (not pop vocal production)

### Instrumentation Detail

Notice specific guitar descriptions:
- "Power chords and melodic lead lines"
- "Tube amp overdrive and natural distortion"
- "Thick power chord progression"
- "Expressive bends and sustain"

**Not:** "electric guitar, distortion, rock sound"

This specificity prevents generic interpretation.

### Vocal Persona (Four Layers)

1. **Demographics:** Male baritone, gritty texture
2. **Technical:** Intimate verses → powerful choruses, slight rasp, vocal fry on low notes
3. **Emotional:** Raw delivery, vulnerability and strength, emotional intensity
4. **Sonic anchor:** Grunge-era vulnerability + Seattle scene power and emotional rawness

This ensures consistent, authentic alternative rock vocals.

### Production Balance

Rock requires balancing rawness with clarity:

```
production: "live recording quality with studio clarity"
```

This tells Suno: Raw energy + professional sound, not lo-fi garage OR sterile pop.

### Meta Tag Dynamic Arc

The song builds from intimate to explosive:

- **Intro:** Raw energy establishing tone
- **Verse 1:** Intimate, restrained (classic rock verse dynamics)
- **Pre-Chorus:** Building intensity (tension before release)
- **Chorus:** Anthemic power, maximum energy
- **Verse 2:** Returns to intensity, heavier than verse 1
- **Bridge:** Stripped down, vulnerable (contrast before climax)
- **Guitar Solo:** Emotional, melodic (not just technical shredding)
- **Final Chorus:** Cathartic climax with all elements

This dynamic journey is essential to rock music structure.

## Expected Result

When properly executed, this prompt should produce:
- Alternative rock sound without pop influences
- Gritty, emotional male vocals (not polished pop vocals)
- Power chord-driven guitars with tube overdrive
- Live-sounding drums with natural dynamics
- Raw energy with studio clarity
- Authentic 90s alternative aesthetic
- Vulnerable verses → powerful choruses dynamic
- No electronic or hip-hop elements
- Anthemic quality without pop hooks

## Common Issues and Fixes

**Issue:** Sound too polished/pop-like
**Fix:** Strengthen "raw, unpolished, live energy" descriptors, increase exclusions, add "garage rock aesthetic"

**Issue:** Vocals too clean
**Fix:** Emphasize "grit, rasp, vocal fry, raw delivery", exclude "Clean Pop Vocals, Polished Vocals"

**Issue:** Guitars sound too clean/sterile
**Fix:** Add "tube amp saturation, vintage overdrive, not scooped mids, garage tone"

**Issue:** Modern pop-rock instead of 90s alternative
**Fix:** Strengthen temporal anchor with "1990s production, pre-2000s aesthetic, vintage recording"

**Issue:** Not heavy enough
**Fix:** Increase distortion descriptors, add "heavy power chords, driving rhythm, aggressive energy"

## Variations

### For Heavier Sound (Moving Toward Metal)

```
genre: "alternative metal, heavy rock, aggressive energy, Seattle grunge heaviness with metal intensity"

vocal: "powerful male vocals with aggressive delivery, occasional screaming, intense emotion"

Exclude Styles: Pop, Soft Rock, Clean Production, Melodic Pop
```

### For Softer, More Melodic Alternative

```
genre: "melodic alternative rock, British art rock sensibility with atmospheric layering, experimental yet accessible"

vocal: "clear male vocals with emotional vulnerability, occasional falsetto, restrained power"

instrumentation: "clean guitars with chorus effect, atmospheric layers, subtle electronic textures allowed"

production: "polished but organic, clear mixing, spacious reverb"

Exclude Styles: Pop (still important!), Heavy Metal, Aggressive Rock
```

### For Punk-Influenced Sound

```
genre: "punk rock, post-punk energy, raw DIY aesthetic, fast and aggressive"

vocal: "shouted vocals, raw and untrained quality, urgent delivery, anti-establishment attitude"

instrumentation: "simple power chord progressions, fast tempo, driving eighth notes, minimal production"

production: "garage recording quality, rough mix, fast and loud, three-minute intensity"

Exclude Styles: Pop, Polished Production, Complex Arrangements
```

### For Indie Rock (Less Heavy)

```
genre: "indie rock with jangly guitars, 2000s New York indie aesthetic, post-punk revival energy"

```

## Advanced Techniques

### Guitar Tone Control

For specific tones:
```
instrumentation: "Marshall amp stack character with vintage tubes, not scooped mids, presence in upper-mids, thick low-end from power chords, controlled feedback on sustained notes"
```

### Drum Sound Control

For authentic rock drums:
```
instrumentation: "acoustic drums with natural resonance, overhead mics capturing cymbals, close-miked kick and snare, room mics for ambient bleed, no samples or triggers, human timing variations"
```

### Vocal Grit Control

For texture:
```
vocal: "vocal cord distortion on powerful sections, breath support showing on belted notes, slight vocal break showing strain, emotional rawness prioritized over technical perfection"
```

### Managing Pop Escape

If pop elements still appear despite exclusions:

1. Add more 90s temporal anchors
2. Reference underground/non-commercial artists
3. Emphasize DIY/garage aesthetics
4. Strengthen rawness descriptors
5. Exclude "Arena Rock, Stadium Rock, Mainstream Rock"
6. Add "underground alternative, college radio aesthetic"

## Summary

Rock and alternative music face unique challenges in Suno due to the massive rock → pop gravity well. Success requires:

1. **Strong exclusions** removing pop influence
2. **High style influence** forcing genre adherence
3. **Temporal anchors** (90s aesthetic) escaping modern pop-rock
4. **Raw production descriptors** counteracting pop polish
5. **Specific instrumentation** details preventing generic interpretation
6. **Artist references** anchoring authentic sound
7. **Attitude descriptors** defining rock character beyond instruments

This example demonstrates complete application of these techniques for professional rock/alternative music generation that resists Suno's pop gravity and maintains authentic genre characteristics.
